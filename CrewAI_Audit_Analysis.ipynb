            "  Read IFPI’s Global Music Report 2022 – State of the Industry     here   \n",
            " 22nd   March 2022 – The global recorded music market grew by 18.5% in 2021, driven by growth in paid subscription streaming, according to IFPI, the organisation that represents the recorded music industry worldwide. Figures released today in IFPI’s Global Music Report show total revenues for 2021 were US$25.9 billion.\n",
            "Paid subscription streaming revenues increased by 21.9% US$12.3 billion.  There were 523 million users of paid subscription accounts at the end of 2021.\n",
            "Total streaming (including both paid subscription and advertising-supported) grew by 24.3% to reach US$16.9 billion, or 65.0% of total global recorded music revenues. In addition to streaming revenues, growth was supported by gains in other areas, including physical formats (+16.1%) and performance rights (+4.0%).\n",
            "Record companies are working to drive this continuing growth for the broader music ecosystem.  With local teams and expertise around the globe, they invest in local artists and genres and support their development. In high-potential growth markets across Asia, Latin America and Africa, as well as more mature markets, like Europe and North America, labels are putting down deep roots and helping to foster the continued advancement of vibrant and diverse local music ecosystems. \n",
            "Opening a press conference in London to unveil the report, IFPI Chief Executive Frances Moore expressed concern regarding events in Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian crisis, saying: “IFPI stands with our colleagues across the music community in our support for urgent humanitarian relief for refugees and our call for an end to the violence.”\n",
            "Commenting on the Global Music Report, Moore continued: “Around the world, record companies are engaging at a very local level, to support music cultures and bring on the development of emerging music ecosystems – championing local music and creating the opportunities for it to reach a global audience. As more markets mature, they join with and contribute to the rich, globally interconnected music world.\n",
            "“Consequently, today’s music market is the most competitive in memory.  Fans are enjoying more music than ever and in so many different and new ways.  This creates enormous opportunities for artists. Those who choose to partner with a record company, do so to benefit from the support of agile, highly responsive global teams of experts dedicated to helping them achieve creative and commercial success and build their long-term careers. \n",
            "“As technologies and the online environment continue to evolve and expand, so too do the creative opportunities to share music experiences.  From the metaverse, to in-game content,\n",
            "record companies have invested in the people and the technologies to deliver new, highly interactive experiences – adding to the evolving ways for artists to make connections with their fans.”\n",
            " Growth in the world’s other regions:   \n",
            "Recorded music revenues grew in every region around the world in 2021:\n",
            "  Asia grew by 16.1%, with its largest market, Japan, seeing growth of 9.3%. Excluding Japan the region experienced a 24.6% climb in revenues. In a continuing trend, Asia also accounted for a significant share of the global physical revenues (49.6%). \n",
            "  Australasia experienced growth of 4.1%. Australia (+3.4%) remained a top 10 market globally and New Zealand saw a rise in streaming revenues push the overall market to growth of 8.2%. \n",
            " Revenues in Europe, the second-largest recorded music region in the world, grew by 15.4%, a steep increase on the prior year’s growth rate of 3.2%. The region’s biggest markets all saw double digit percentage growth: UK (+13.2%), Germany (+12.6%) and France (+11.8%). \n",
            "  Latin America saw growth of 31.2% – one of the highest growth rates globally. Streaming accounted for 85.9% of the market, one of the highest proportions in any region. \n",
            "  Middle East and North Africa – split out as a separate region in the Global Music Report for the first time – experienced growth of 35.0%; the fastest regional growth rate globally. Streaming was a particularly strong driver in the region, with a 95.3% share of the market. \n",
            "  Sub-Saharan Africa – also split out for the first time in IFPI’s reporting – saw revenue growth of 9.6% in 2021, largely driven by streaming. Ad-supported was particularly strong in this region, with revenues from this format growing by 56.4%. \n",
            " The USA & Canada region grew by 22.0% in 2021, outpacing the global growth rate. The USA market alone grew by 22.6% and Canadian recorded music revenues grew by 12.6%. \n",

            "  20,000 foot view:  Music streaming and the attention recession have turned music into a background activity. Artists en masse are struggling to cut through the noise, realising that streaming is neither a place to build deeper relationships with fans nor to generate meaningful income. Adding to this momentum, music’s key audiences are seeking out more active, participatory experiences with music. These three factors are catalysing the emergence of a new, counterculture music business that hinges on the artist-fan relationship, and the platforms that enable them. This is the platform era, and traditional stakeholders will need to reposition their value in this new landscape.  \n",
            "  Key insights    \n",
            "  \n",
            " As artists earn more, they rely less on streaming revenue, with streaming accounting for        of revenue for artists earning less than        annually, but only        of revenue for artists earning over         \n",
            " Music streaming is predominantly a passive experience, as        of consumers stream music in the background of other activities, and just        say they focus mainly on the music when streaming it  \n",
            " Even for music aficionados, music makes up a smaller share of total entertainment time than social and video, which, together, account for more than half of entertainment time  \n",
            " A combination of these factors is leading artists to invest less time in streaming, and more time on platforms that better allow them to build and monetise fanbases  \n",
            " Music aficionados over-index for behaviours that serve their needs for participation, community, and ownership, leading them to platforms like TikTok and Twitch  \n",
            " The youngest consumer generations seek active, social experiences with content, which cannot be found on traditional Western streaming services — so, the next generation of fandom and culture is building on non-DSP platforms  \n",
            " As artists’ objectives change and consumer behaviour shifts, the music industry is entering the platform era  \n",
            " Music’s traditional stakeholders must reposition their value in this new landscape where music companies, which hinge on social, creator ecosystems, and fandom are best placed to succeed   \n",
